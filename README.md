# Physical-Structure
Arduous and currently inaccurate modeling of a physical structure composed of nodes
Physical Structure is composed of Physical Nodes. Truss is a Physical Structure Object.

**WARNING**: DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT AS IT IS NOT ENTIRELY TESTED AND BENCHMARKED. I NEED TO ADD CORRECT ANGLE AND DIRECTION FUNCTIONALITY.

THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
